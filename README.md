# Scripts

This repository contains various scripts I have written to assist with tedious tasks. Each script is designed to automate a specific task, making it easier and more efficient.

## Contents

### 1. Video Frame Extractor -- video_slicer

This Python script is used to extract frames from video files. It uses the OpenCV library to read video files and write frames as images. [Read more](./video_slicer/README.md)

### 2. HEIC to JPEG Converter -- heic_to_jpg

This Python script is used to convert HEIC image files to JPEG format. It uses the Wand library to read HEIC files and write them as JPEG files. [Read more](./heic_to_jpg/README.md)

## Future Projects

This repository will be updated with more scripts as they are developed. Each script will have its own directory and README file explaining its purpose, dependencies, and usage.

## Usage

To use these scripts, navigate to the specific project directory and follow the instructions in the project's README file.
